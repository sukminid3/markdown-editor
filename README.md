## Learning
1. How to use React and Typescript together.
2. Build an interative browser-bassed coding environment (Just like a Jupyter Notebook, but for Javascript, with many additional features added in.)
3. Bundling and transpiling code directly in the browser. This is a task normally done by running Webpack and babel at your terminl. 
4. Deploy the project using a multi-package architecture to NPM, where it can be easily downloaded and run the project.
